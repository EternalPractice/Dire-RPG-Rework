# Dire RPG Rework

In the past I was working on building a SPA with pure vanilla JS. The work can be found at [www.direRPG.xzy](www.direrpg.xyz).

Partway through the project I encountered the following issues with this approach:

1. The way I was handling updating the body of the page made the routing not work. Manually changing the URL in browswer would not update the page.
2. I made a bunch of nested components, and changing the inner components would break the outer components.
3. I was making this up as I went along, not following any real pattern. Refactoring was a nightmare.

At this point I decided to learn a frontend framework, and after some initial experimentation decided on Vue JS.

This is a slow, long WIP. I'm currently identifying and building individual components.
