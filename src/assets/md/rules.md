# System overview

# Dice Mechanics

Dire RPG, like a lot of other RPG systems, uses a d20 (20-sided die) to simulate luck and determine if an action succeeds or fails. Unlike a lot of other systems however, it uses a d20 for every roll. There are no separate dice used for damage, no percentile dice, or coin flips. Every action's success & outcome is determined with a single die roll.

For every action, there is an associated skill with levels 1 through 20. To perform an action successfully, the number rolled on the d20 must be equal to or lower than the skill level. How well the action is performed is also determined by this roll and is called the **degree of success**. To determine the degree of success, take the number rolled and divide it by 2, then round to the nearest whole number.

Modifiers can be added or subtracted to the roll if conditions call for it. If the circumstances would make an action harder than it usually is (like high winds while climbing a mountain or trying to calm a wild stallion during a thunderstorm), a **negative modifier** would be applied to the roll. This number would be -1 through -10, -1 being slightly harder and -10 being nigh impossible. This modifier would affect the maximum skill level, limiting how successful the action can be. For example, if a character with 15 skill in athletics tries to swim in rough rapids (-6 modifier), then they would need to roll a 9 or lower to succeed.

**Positive modifier**s can also be applied when circumstances would make an action easier than it usually is. This number would be from +1 through +10. This modifier affects both the roll and maximum skill level. For example, a character attempting to attack a helpless foe who was tied up to a tree would have a +10 to the attack roll. If they had an attack skill of 10, then they would have to roll under a 20 to succeed & add 10 to the roll when determining the degree of success. This simulates the attack being both easier to perform & easier to do more damage.

Multiple modifiers, positive and negative, can take place in the same action. If they do, add all modifiers together for a final modifier. For example, if a character is trying to sneak past a guard inside a prison during a loud riot (+6) but is wearing very bright prison garb (-4), they modifier would be +2 in total.

A character may also spend MP to add their own bonus to the roll after the modifier is determined & before the d20 is rolled. For more information on MP, see the section [on MP, labeled appropriately].

In summary, every action performed has these steps involved:

1. Determine the total modifier, if any apply at all.
2. Add MP modifier (optional)
3. Roll the d20, and add the modifiers. Remember that positive/negative modifiers effect the roll in different ways.
4. If the number rolled is equal to or less than the player skill it succeeds.
5. On a successful roll, divide that number by 2, and that is your degree of success.

# Outcome Tables, or How Successful Are You?

For most actions, the degree of success calculated in the previous section will be enough to determine how successful an action is. Most actions will have a challenge rating (or **CR**) of 1 through 10, matching the degrees of success. Meet or beat the CR and you will succeed. Passing the roll but not beating the CR means you don't achieve your goals, but don't fail either. Failing vs not achieving goals mean different things depending on the action taken, see the [skills section] for specific info.

For other actions, the degrees of success won't be enough to determine how successful you are. These actions will have an accompanying **outcome table** to determine the outcome. This is typically used when calculating damage of weapons.

For an example, see the outcome table for damage on a dagger:

| degree of success |  outcome  |
| :---------------: | :-------: |
|         1         | 1 damage  |
|         2         | 2 damage  |
|         3         | 3 damage  |
|         4         | 5 damage  |
|         5         | 6 damage  |
|         6         | 7 damage  |
|         7         | 9 damage  |
|         8         | 10 damage |
|         9         | 11 damage |
|        10         | 15 damage |
