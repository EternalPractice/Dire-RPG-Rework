# System overview

<u>**Goals**</u>:

- Let the players build the exact character they want.
- Have attributes & character options make a large impact in how the game is played.
- In the luck vs skill spectrum, weight it more on skill than luck.
- Make the rules in such a way that complex actions can be pulled off, but only a few rules need to be called to pull it off.

<u>**Eventual Goals**</u>:

- Introduce races into the system.
- Have magic feel and behave differently than martial weapons.

# Dice Mechanics

Dire RPG, like a lot of other RPG systems, uses a d20 (20-sided die) to simulate luck and determine if an action succeeds or fails. Unlike a lot of other systems however, it uses a d20 for every roll. There are no separate dice used for damage, no percentile dice, or coin flips. Every action's success & outcome is determined with a single die roll.

For every action, there is an associated skill with levels 1 through 20. To perform an action successfully, the number rolled on the d20 must be equal to or lower than the skill level. How well the action is performed is also determined by this roll and is called the **degree of success**. To determine the degree of success, take the number rolled and divide it by 2, then round to the nearest whole number.

Modifiers can be added or subtracted to the roll if conditions call for it. If the circumstances would make an action harder than it usually is (like high winds while climbing a mountain or trying to calm a wild stallion during a thunderstorm), a **negative modifier** would be applied to the roll. This number would be -1 through -10, -1 being slightly harder and -10 being nigh impossible. This modifier would affect the maximum skill level, limiting how successful the action can be. For example, if a character with 15 skill in athletics tries to swim in rough rapids (-6 modifier), then they would need to roll a 9 or lower to succeed.

**Positive modifier**s can also be applied when circumstances would make an action easier than it usually is. This number would be from +1 through +10. This modifier affects both the roll and maximum skill level. For example, a character attempting to attack a helpless foe who was tied up to a tree would have a +10 to the attack roll. If they had an attack skill of 10, then they would have to roll under a 20 to succeed & add 10 to the roll when determining the degree of success. This simulates the attack being both easier to perform & easier to do more damage.

Multiple modifiers, positive and negative, can take place in the same action. If they do, add all modifiers together for a final modifier. For example, if a character is trying to sneak past a guard inside a prison during a loud riot (+6) but is wearing very bright prison garb (-4), they modifier would be +2 in total.

A character may also spend MP to add their own bonus to the roll after the modifier is determined & before the d20 is rolled. For more information on MP, see the section [Mental Power (MP)](<#Mental-Power-(MP)>).

In summary, every action performed has these steps involved:

1. Determine the total modifier, if any apply at all.
2. Add MP modifier (optional)
3. Roll the d20, and add the modifiers. Remember that positive/negative modifiers effect the roll in different ways.
4. If the number rolled is equal to or less than the player skill it succeeds.
5. On a successful roll, divide that number by 2, and that is your degree of success.

# Outcome Tables, or How Successful Are You?

For most actions, the degree of success calculated in the previous section will be enough to determine how successful an action is. Most actions will have a challenge rating (or **CR**) of 1 through 10, matching the degrees of success. Meet or beat the CR and you will succeed. Passing the roll but not beating the CR means you don't achieve your goals, but don't fail either. Failing vs not achieving goals mean different things depending on the action taken, see the [skills section] for specific info.

For other actions, the degrees of success won't be enough to determine how successful you are. These actions will have an accompanying **outcome table** to determine the outcome. This is typically used when calculating damage of weapons.

For an example, see the outcome table for damage on a dagger:

| degree of success |  outcome  |
| :---------------: | :-------: |
|         1         | 1 damage  |
|         2         | 2 damage  |
|         3         | 3 damage  |
|         4         | 5 damage  |
|         5         | 6 damage  |
|         6         | 7 damage  |
|         7         | 9 damage  |
|         8         | 10 damage |
|         9         | 11 damage |
|        10         | 15 damage |

# Attributes

There are 6 attributes in Dire RPG: Strength, Endurance, Agility, Reflexes, Intelligence, and Willpower. These 6 attributes determine most of what a character can learn, what weapons & armor they can wear, and how much they can do in a turn. Each attribute score is valued 1-5, and all start at 3 by default. In order to increase a score, you must decrease another.

## Strength

<u>Benefits:</u>

- Determines what armor you can wear.
- Determines base damage for unarmed strikes.
- Determines what weapons and armor you can use.
- Determines what strength based perk you can learn.

## Endurance

<u>Benefits:</u>

- Determines how much health (HP) you have.
- Determines what Fortitude saves you automatically pass.

## Agility

<u>Benefits:</u>

- Determines how far you can move for each movement action.
- Determines what agility based perks you can learn.

## Reflexes

<u>Benefits:</u>

- Determines how much ability points (AP) you have.
- Determines what Reflex saves you automatically pass.

## Intelligence

<u>Benefits:</u>

- Determines how much experience points (XP) you gain per mission.
- Determines what intelligence based perks you can learn.

## Willpower

<u>Benefits:</u>

- Determines how much mental power (MP) you have.
- Determines what Will saves you automatically pass.

## Health Points (HP)

Health determines how much damage a character can take before passing out or dying. Each point of endurance grants the character 20 HP for a maximum of 100 HP. Characters do not gain HP during the game, but instead increase their survivability through gear and perks.

When a character reaches 0 HP or less, they pass out unconscious and unable to do anything for the rest of the mission. When a character is unconscious, they are considered fighting for their life. See [Section of "fighting for your life"] for more details.

| Endurance Score | HP  |
| :-------------: | :-: |
|        1        | 20  |
|        2        | 40  |
|        3        | 60  |
|        4        | 80  |
|        5        | 100 |

## Ability Points (AP)

Ability points determine how many actions a character can perform during a given turn. Each point of reflexes grants the character 3 AP for a maximum of 15 AP.

Each action will have an associated AP cost from 1-5, really fast actions costing 1 and really slow actions costing 5. Some high level perks will grant options that can greatly exceed 5 AP, such as casting a powerful spell that requires preparation. For more information on how to use AP, see the [proper section] for more detail.

| Agility Score | AP  |
| :-----------: | :-: |
|       1       |  3  |
|       2       |  6  |
|       3       |  9  |
|       4       | 12  |
|       5       | 15  |

## Mental Power (MP)

Mental power is used to add another positive modifier to a roll, allowing the character to temporarily push beyond it's limits. Each point of Willpower grants the character 5 MP for a maximum of 25 MP.

As described in the previous section [Dice Mechanics](#Dice-Mechanics), MP's purpose is to modify a roll to increase the character's ability to perform an action better.

| Willpower Score | AP  |
| :-------------: | :-: |
|        1        |  5  |
|        2        | 10  |
|        3        | 15  |
|        4        | 20  |
|        5        | 25  |

## Experience Points (XP)

Experience points are gained through successful [missions, rename this] and are used to increase a character's skill level or to purchase perks. After each successful [mission, rename this] a character will gain the XP stated multiplied by their intelligence score. These points can be spent during the end of day, or upkeep section.

## Speed

Speed determines how far a character can travel during a move action. Each point of agility allows the character to move 1 extra tile per movement action. Each movement action costs 1 AP.

# Saves

Most actions a character will take are chosen by their player. Sometimes however, a character is caught off guard and has to make an action there were not expecting. These actions are considered saves and have their own set of skills associated with them: fortitude saves, reflex saves and will saves. Saves are considered pass/fail, where negative effects happen when it is failed.

## Fortitude Saves

Fortitude saves concern withstanding a shock to the physical body, or experiences trauma. Examples include opening a refrigerator and smelling meat that expired 2 years ago, jumping into a hot spring only to find the water freezing, or unknowingly drinking poison.

A fortitude save will have a challenge rating between 1-10. A character will automatically pass the fortitude save if their endurance score is equal to or above the challenge rating.

## Reflex Saves

Reflex saves are involved when a character has to suddenly move quickly. Examples include jumping off a trap door as it springs open, catching a cork that flew violently off a champaign bottle, or catching yourself when slipping off a tightrope.

A reflex save will have a challenge rating between 1-10. A character will automatically pass the reflex save if their reflex score is equal to or above the challenge rating.

## Will Saves

Will saves are involved when a character has to keep mental focus against distracting circumstances. Examples include keeping a straight face during negotiations when hearing something shocking, keeping your incantation straight during casting a long spell in combat, or not being overwhelmed by fear when facing your phobia.

A will save will have a challenge rating between 1-10. A character will automatically pass the reflex save if their willpower score is equal to or above the challenge rating.

# The 9 Schools

Within the larger college, there are individual schools that are headed by a dean who runs their own staff. Each school focuses on a particular area of study which are suited to characters with particular attributes. These schools are where characters can learn new perks, study magic, or obtain specialized tools. Each school has a primary attribute focus and a secondary primary attribute focus (see table below). Some schools focus on one and only one attribute and will have a higher requirement for obtaining perks.

| School Name                  | Primary Attribute | Secondary Attribute |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------- | :------------------ |
| School of Might              | Strength          | Strength            |
| School of Physical Adeptness | Strength          | Agility             |
| School of Superior Tactics   | Strength          | Intelligence        |
| School of Nimbleness         | Agility           | Agility             |
| School of Acrobatic Strength | Agility           | Strength            |
| School of Deft Cleverness    | Agility           | Intelligence        |
| School of Pure Reason        | Intelligence      | Intelligence        |
| School of Intelligent Combat | Intelligence      | Strength            |
| School of Clever Trickery    | Intelligence      | Agility             |

## Perks

Perks are the special abilities that differentiate one character from another. This can include anything from weapon specialization, machine hacking, alchemy/chemistry skill, and many others. Perks are where the interesting things happen.

Each perk has a level associated with it from 1-5. Level 1 perks are the simpler abilities while level 5 perks are the expert level abilities. Each perk has a XP and attribute requirement based on the level (See table below). When the school has both it's primary and secondary attributes matching, the requirement per level will be higher.

| Perk Level | XP Requirement | Primary Attribute | Secondary Attribute | Primary & Secondary Attribute |
| :--------: | :------------: | :---------------: | :-----------------: | :---------------------------: |
|     1      |       5        |         1         |          1          |               2               |
|     2      |       10       |         2         |          2          |               3               |
|     3      |       15       |         3         |          3          |               4               |
|     4      |       20       |         4         |          3          |               5               |
|     5      |       25       |         5         |          3          |               5               |

Characters can gain these perks during their downtime, see [Section on downtime] for more information.

## Special Perks

Some perks are school secrets and are guarded by the deans, only being taught to those they trust. If a character would pursue learning one of these perks, they would need to obtain approval from the school dean. The dean would then give them a series of tasks that the character would need to do on their missions to earn the ability to obtain these perks. These tasks vary from school to school and from dean to dean.

# Weapons

[Weapons in this system should have an overview. Rewrite this later.]

## Strength Requirement

Each weapon will have a required level of strength to use. A character who does not meet this requirement will not be able to use the weapon properly, and the weapon will be considered a [basic level 1 weapon].

## Size

Each weapon will have a size of 1-handed or 2-handed. A character must use that many hands in order to wield the weapon. There is no penalty for wielding 2 1-handed weapons.

## AP Cost

Each weapon will cost a certain amount of AP to use, indicated by it's AP cost. Each action the weapon can perform will use up this much AP.

## Passive Bonuses

Some weapons will grant the user bonuses while a character is wielding it. Shields for example will grant the character extra AC while some masterwork level weapons will add a positive modifier to the associated skill check.

## Slot Size

Each weapon will have a slot size which represents how much physical space it takes up. In order to pack a weapon, a character must have armor/backpack with enough free slots to accommodate the weapon.

## Ammo Type (Ranged)

Each ranged weapon will have an associated ammo type. Without ammo a ranged weapon cannot work.

## Clip Size (Ranged)

Each ranged weapon will have an amount of ammo it can hold in it's clip before it needs to be reloaded.

## Reload Speed (Ranged)

Reloading a clip/weapon takes an amount of AP indicated by the reload speed.

## Recoil (Ranged)

Recoil is the "kick" the weapon produces when firing. When making multiple shots in a single turn, apply the recoil penalty to each shot after the first. The recoil penalty will stack.

For example, if a character is firing a hunting rifle with recoil of -4, the first shot will have no penalty. The second shot will have a -4 penalty, the third -8, and so on.

## Actions

Each weapon will have a list of actions it can perform & an associated outcome table with each. Some weapons will only have 1 action while others may have many (attack, block, parry with a sword). Actions may have an associated modifier with them if the weapon is ill suited to the task. Attempting to parry with a great sword would be much harder than short sword, and attempt to parry with a sai would be easier. In this parry example, a short sword would have no modifier, the great sword would have -4 while the sai would have +2.

Actions that add a non-damaging effect (such as increasing DR while blocking) do not stack with itself. When a character makes multiple of these actions in a turn, they apply the best bonus. For example, if a character wishes to block with a shield and rolls a 3, they can redo the action for a better score. If the next score is a 8, then they try again and roll a 6, the 8 still is the value used.

---

# Armor

Unlike other games, armor plays a bigger factor than just protection. Armor is where your character will find slots to store gear, so armor determines how many items you can carry. Armor also can have special properties such as a gas mask to nullify poison clouds, muffled boots to improve sneaking, and hidden compartments to smuggle items. Each piece of armor has a strength requirement, and each piece covers one section of the character (head, body, arms, legs).

## Armor Class (AC)

Armor can have an armor class associated with it, meaning it will be harder for the enemy to hit you. The number associated with the AC will be a negative modifier to anyone who tries to attack that part of the character.

## Damage Reduction (DR)

Armor can have a damage reduction associated with it that will reduce the damage the character takes. For example, if a character gets hit with 6 damage, but has 3 DR, then the character will only take 3 damage instead. Damage can only be reduced to 1, meaning a character who is hit will always take at least 1 point of damage.

## Slots, Slot Speed, Hidden Slots

Each piece of armor will have slots for items to be stored. Those slots will also have a slot speed associated with them, which will state how much AP will be needed to access items from each slot. Some slots will have a hidden number assigned to them, meaning that any item stored in this slot is hidden to outside viewers until it is searched for. The number associated with the hidden slot is the DC to discover the hidden item on a search.

## Special Properties

Some armor, usually either rare finds or customized gear, will have special properties with them. These act the same as perks the character has as long as they are wearing the armor.

---

# Magic Types

Like there are many different types of combat styles, there are different types of magic users. Each style of magic has it's own casting costs and unique spells associated with it.

## Arcane

Acquired after years of study.

- XP cost for acquiring spells increased by one tier.
- Spells are prepped ahead of time, holding 1 AP until the spell is cast.
- Spells can be transferred into gems, allowing others to access them.

## Sorcery

For those who are born with the gift of magic.

- All spells cost MP along with AP.

## Blood Magic

Using ones own life force to bend magic.

- All spells cost HP along with AP.
- Does not gain access to healing spells.
- Any MP cost associated with a spell costs HP instead.

## Divine Magic / Pact Magic

Magic that is gained from an outside, supernatural force.

- All magic is granted through the entity the character works with.
- Spells can be learned as soon as the entity grants permission.
- Spells can be taken away if the entity decides to.
- Users of this type of magic must work with their deity/patron.

## Witchery

Magic that is used like a craft.

- XP cost for acquiring spells is decreased by one tier.
- All spells are cast through rituals, tripling the casting time.
- All spells require items & a spoken incantation to work.
- Spells power can be increased with the use of a cauldron.
